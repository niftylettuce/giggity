He's Quagmire! Quagmire! You never really know what he's gonna do next (on your CLI)!

```bash
npm install -g giggity
giggity
```

The previous command `$ giggity` will output an audio clip and a random Quagmire image on the command line.

Example output:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/niftylettuce/giggity/master/quagmire.png" alt="" />

This module is a fun demonstration of [picture-tube][1] and [play.js][2].

Also try resizing your terminal window and running it again.
